# Week 3 Day 2 â€” Flask API (PUT & DELETE)

### ðŸ“… Date: Oct 8, 2025  
### ðŸŽ¯ Goal:
Implement and test **PUT** & **DELETE** endpoints in Flask for task updates and deletions.

---

## ðŸ”§ Features
- `PUT /api/tasks/<id>` â†’ Update a task by ID  
- `DELETE /api/tasks/<id>` â†’ Delete a task by ID  
- Handles invalid IDs and returns proper error codes  
- Optional query filter: `/api/tasks?completed=true`

---

## ðŸ§ª Test Commands
```bash
GET    http://127.0.0.1:5000/api/tasks
POST   http://127.0.0.1:5000/api/tasks
PUT    http://127.0.0.1:5000/api/tasks/1
DELETE http://127.0.0.1:5000/api/tasks/1
# Week 3 Day 3 â€” Error Handling, Validation & CORS (Portility API)

**Goal:** Improve the Flask backend with robust error handling, validation, and CORS support.

### âœ… Completed Tasks
- Added error handlers for `404`, `400`, and `500`.
- Validated incoming JSON and non-empty `title` fields.
- Enabled **CORS** using `Flask-CORS` to allow frontend requests.
- Tested all endpoints (`GET`, `POST`, `PUT`, `DELETE`) in **Postman** and frontend.
- Implemented safe error responses with proper HTTP status codes.

### ðŸ§ª Tools Used
- Flask + Flask-CORS  
- Postman (for endpoint testing)  
- React frontend (fetch API calls)

### ðŸš€ Run Locally
```bash
# backend
cd backend
venv\Scripts\activate
python app.py

# frontend
cd frontend
npm run dev
# Week 3 Day 4 â€” Docs & Versioning

**Goal:** Add OpenAPI docs and version the API.

**What I did**
- Moved routes under `/api/v1` using Flask Blueprints.
- Added `backend/static/openapi.yaml` (OpenAPI 3.0).
- Served Swagger UI at `/docs` using `flask-swagger-ui`.
- Tested locally and demonstrated running with Gunicorn.

**How to run**
1. Start Flask (dev): `python app.py`  
2. Open docs: `http://127.0.0.1:5000/docs`  
3. For multi-worker: `gunicorn -w 4 -b 0.0.0.0:8000 app:app`
# Week 3 Day 5 â€” Reflection & Bonus

## Overview
This day focuses on API reflection, authentication, logging, and testing.

## What Was Done
- Added request logging with `logging` module.
- Added simple Bearer Token authentication decorator.
- Created basic unit tests using `pytest`.
- Wrote reflections on:
  - HTTP requestâ€“response cycle.
  - Security best practices.
  - Production error monitoring.

## Test Commands
```bash
pytest -v
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer supersecret123" http://127.0.0.1:5000/api/tasks
# Week 4 Day 1 â€” SQL Basics & Schema Design

### ðŸŽ¯ Objective
Design and create the SQL schema for storing tasks in a relational database.

### ðŸ§± Table: `tasks`
| Column | Type | Description |
|---------|------|--------------|
| id | INTEGER PRIMARY KEY | Task ID |
| title | TEXT | Title of task |
| description | TEXT | Task details |
| status | TEXT | Pending, done, etc. |
| due_date | TEXT | YYYY-MM-DD |
| created_at | DATETIME | Created timestamp |
| updated_at | DATETIME | Last update |

### ðŸ“˜ Key Learnings
- Normalization avoids redundancy.
- Use appropriate SQL types (`INTEGER`, `TEXT`, `DATE`).
- Plan ahead for scalability â€” user & tags relations can be added later.

### ðŸ§© Next
Connect Flask backend to SQLite (Week 4 Day 2).
