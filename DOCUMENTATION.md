# Portility — Week 2 Day 1

**Date:** Sept 29, 2025  
**Goal:** Setup React + Vite, folder structure, and first component.

### ✅ Tasks Completed
- Scaffolded frontend with React + Vite.  
- Installed Material UI.  
- Created folder structure: components (NavBar), pages (Home).  
- Implemented NavBar (AppBar + Toolbar).  
- Implemented Home page using Box + Typography.  

### ❓ Reflection
1. **Vite produces:** src/, index.html, vite.config.js. Dev: fast hot reload. Build: optimized dist/.  
2. **Hot reload/bundling:** Updates browser instantly; combines files for production.  
3. **React structure:** Parent → Child; props passed down; re-render happens on prop/state change.
